# T-Net
Automated Recognition of Snow-Covered and Icy Road Surfaces Based on T-Net in Mount Tianshan

Hello, here is the T-Net repository, we will put all of our materials and models here later, please waite for us!

Here, we upload the related resources and training results of different structural models, but the datasets is too big to upload. Connecting me if you need.
